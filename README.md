# VR Bomb Puzzle

This VR Unity game is a timed, interactive puzzle based on the flowchart shown below. The player follows a sequence of actions such as selecting tools, fitting shapes, cutting wires, or entering a code in order to successfully “defuse” the object. Using VR makes the experience more immersive, since the player has to physically reach out, grab items, and interact with objects in a 3D space. This adds a level of realism and urgency that increases engagement, improves hand–eye coordination, and supports problem-solving in a more practical, skill-based way than a regular desktop game.

Below is a diagram explaining the flow of the game from the player's perspective.
